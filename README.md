This is a basic OpenGL demo I did for a graphics course. Note that it uses a lot of OpenGl methods that are since deprecated.  glBegin() and glEnd() are methods that have been replaced by shaders in subsequent versions of OpenGL.
It does however give a basic demonstration of how to do basic vertex drawing, vertex coloring, various types of lighting (ambient and diffuse), shading, texturing, and mouse and camera control.

For basic explanation of how OpenGL and the graphics pipeline, please refer to the following resources:

* [OpenGL Red Book] (http://www.glprogramming.com/red/) - The standard OpenGL reference book.
* [OpenGL Tranformation and the OpenGL Pipeline] (http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_transform.html) - A very good explanation of the graphics pipeline and the appropriate transformations that vertices go through in the pipeline.
* [Open GL 3.3 Tutorials] (http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/) - This is a very good tutorial site, however it does use shaders which are a feature of later versions of OpenGl not used in this project.

Please also see my other graphics project that mimics this project, but instead of using OpenGl I do a full implementation of the vertice transformation portions of the pipeline by myself.
